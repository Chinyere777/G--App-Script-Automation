# G--App-Script-Automation

This project leverages Google Apps Script to automate the handling and organization of form responses submitted via Google Forms. The script runs in real-time using the **On Form Submit** trigger to process responses and organize them across multiple spreadsheets with specific formats.

## Key Features:
 **Automated Form Response Handling**: Once a form is submitted, the script automatically processes the response and identifies the corresponding team member by their name.
 **Dynamic Data Distribution**: Based on the individualâ€™s name, responses are moved from the default "Form Response" spreadsheet to their specific sheet in the **"Rejection Validation Spreadsheet"**.
 **Custom Formatting**: Responses are reformatted according to predefined templates to ensure they meet the needs of both individual and team-wide tracking.
 **Backend Data Management**: A separate **"Backend Spreadsheet"** is updated with another distinct format for internal use or further processing.

This project streamlines the workflow of managing form submissions, improving efficiency for team members and making data handling more consistent and easier to track.
